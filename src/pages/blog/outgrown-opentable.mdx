# 5 Signs Your Restaurant Group Has Outgrown OpenTable

*Published: February 6, 2025 | Author: Tom Akiyama*

OpenTable is a great starting point for single-location restaurants. But as your restaurant group grows, you might notice some pain points that signal it's time for a more scalable solution.

## 1. You're Managing Multiple Dashboards

If you're logging into separate OpenTable accounts for each location, you're wasting time. A multi-location platform gives you one dashboard for all locations.

## 2. You Don't Know Your Regulars Across Locations

When a VIP from your downtown location visits the new waterfront spot, does the host know? With OpenTable, guest data is siloed by location. Modern platforms track guests across your entire group.

## 3. Your Analytics Don't Tell the Whole Story

Comparing performance across locations shouldn't require exporting CSVs and building spreadsheets. Cross-location analytics should be built-in.

## 4. Floor Plan Updates Are a Hassle

Rearranging tables for a private event shouldn't require calling support. You need a platform where your team can update floor plans themselves.

## 5. Your Costs Are Climbing

OpenTable's per-cover fees add up fast for high-volume groups. Flat-rate pricing makes more sense as you scale.
